RASSINE is a free access `<https://github.com/pegasilab/rassine>`_ Python3 code,
which is a simple tool to normalise spectra with the least amount of required user fine-tuning.

The original code was written by `Michaël Crétignier <https://github.com/MichaelCretignier>`_ and is available at 
`<https://github.com/MichaelCretignier/Rassine_public>`_. Parts were written by Jérémie Francfort.

The code was modularized and packaged using Poetry by `Denis Rosset <https://github.com/denisrosset>`_.
During that process, the interactive parts of RASSINE were removed, keeping fully automated
processing of spectra.
